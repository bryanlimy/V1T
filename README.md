## Installation
- Create a new [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment with Python 3.8.
  ```bash
  conda create -n sensorium python=3.8
  ```
- Activate `sensorium` virtual environment
  ```bash
  conda activate sensorium
  ```
- Install all dependencies (including CUDA and cuDNN) and packages with `setup.sh` script, works on both Linus and macOS. Note: if you are running Mac with Apple Silicon, the script will automatically install `tensorflow-macos` and `tensorflow-metal` for accelerated workload.
  ```bash
  sh setup.sh
  ```
- Restart environment
  ```
  conda deactivate
  conda activate sensorium
  ```

## Pull Requests (PRs)
- Always create a new branch to work on a/any features.
- When your branch is ready, create a PR on GitHub.
- Every PR should be reviewed and approved by another person.
- Once a PR has been approved, the submitter should select **`Squash and merge`** to merge the branch into `main` as a **single** commit.
## Reviewing PRs
Quality reviews are really important. You should spend time reviewing the code your peers write (not just fixing their mistakes without saying anything). If you can't review something because you don't understand what they're doing, there's something very wrong with their code, not you. Ask clarifying questions and suggest ways for them to make their code more interpretable. Request they put comments where comment are necessary.

If your code is being reviewed, don't be insulted or annoyed at requests to reformat/add comments. Err on the side of helping your colleagues understand your work. We should all have [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) installed (e.g. `pip install black`) and use the following methods to apply `black`:
- Command line:
  ```
  black <file>
  ```
- [PyCharm](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html#pycharm-intellij-idea)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html#visual-studio-code)
- [SublimeText 3](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html#sublimetext-3)
